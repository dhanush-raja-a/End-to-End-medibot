### 🔧 Best Practices to Follow  
1. **Add badges** (e.g., Build status, license, Python version) using shields.io to convey quality at a glance.  
2. **Use relative image paths** if you include screenshots or diagrams—for instance: `![](screenshots/demo.png)`  [oai_citation:2‡freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:3‡cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/guides/web-performance/4-ways-to-add-images-to-github-readme-1-bonus-method?utm_source=chatgpt.com).  
3. **Keep content updated**, especially project purpose, setup instructions, and model versions  [oai_citation:4‡freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
